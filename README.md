Overview of the Basic Calculator Project
Objective
The Basic Calculator project is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations. It is a beginner-friendly Java program that demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts like input/output, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic.

Features:

1.User-Friendly Interface:
2.Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
3.Provides a menu for choosing arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Operations Supported:

1.Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.
2.Subtraction: Calculates the difference between two numbers.
3.Multiplication: Finds the product of two numbers.
4.Division: Divides one number by another, with a safeguard against division by zero.

Error Handling:
1.Ensures valid operation selection.
2.Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.

Result Display:
1.Shows the result of the operation in a clear and concise format.

Learning Objectives
This project helps learners:
1.Understand the basics of Java programming.
2.Use the Scanner class for reading user input.
3.Work with conditional statements (switch, if-else) for logic implementation.
4.Perform basic error handling.
